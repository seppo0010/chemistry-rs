# Chemistry-rs

This project attempt to model chemistry in Rust. It is not meant to be useful
for problem solving or accurate, but more of a tool to understand chemistry
from a programmers perspective. It is helping me explore the rules the
chemistry models follows and ask myself question I would not otherwise.
